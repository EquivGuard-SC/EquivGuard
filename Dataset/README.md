# Dataset

- **_RQ1_**: Includes an open-source dataset of 287,267 Ethereum contract source codes from the smart-contract-sanctuary-ethereum repository, which has been authenticated by Etherscan.

- **_RQ2_**: Includes sampled data from EquivGuard's large-scale detection results, manually analyzed for false positives and false negatives to assess Precision and Recall. We used a confidence interval-based sampling method with a 95% confidence level and a 10 confidence interval.

- **_RQ3_**: Contains the analysis of multi-chain asset distribution and transactions of contracts containing EVM Inequivalent Defects, along with corresponding analysis scripts. Data from six mainstream chains (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Avalanche) was collected from DefiLlama to ensure effective analysis.
